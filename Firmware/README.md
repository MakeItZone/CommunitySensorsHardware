Arduino sketches are in their own directories.

There are a number of library and tool dependencies- a snapshot of the required libraries is in `Arduino-LibrariesAndTools.zip`. Unzip this in your Arduino Sketch directory. You can find out how to find that [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries).
